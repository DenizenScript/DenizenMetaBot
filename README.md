DenizenMetaBot
--------------

A Discord bot for Denizen 1.x (Bukkit) meta documentation.

This is a C#/.NETCore based Discord bot.

Created by mcmonkey and the DenizenScript team.

## Setup

Gathering the files note:
- In addition to a `git clone` of this repository, you need to clone the sub-repository, using a command like `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

The `start.sh` file is used by the `restart` command and should be maintained as correct to the environment to launch a new bot program instance... points of note:
- It starts with a `git pull` command to self-update. If this is not wanted, remove it. Be careful what repository this will pull from (a fork you own vs. the original repository vs. some other one...)
- It uses a `screen` command to launch the bot quietly into a background screen. The `screen` program must be installed for that to work. Alternately, replace it with some other equivalent background terminal program.
- The restart command will run this script equivalently to the following terminal command: `bash ./start.sh 12345` where `12345` is the ID number for the channel that issued a restart command.

To configure the bot:
- Create directory `config` within this bot's directory.
- Within the `config` directory, create file `token.txt` containing only the Discord bot token without newlines or anything else.
    - To create a bot token, refer to official Discord documentation. Alternately, you can follow the bot-user-creation parts of https://discord.foxbot.me/stable/guides/getting_started/first-bot.html (ignore the coding parts, just follow the first bits about creating a bot user on the Discord application system, and getting the token).
- Optionally, within the `config` directory, create file `quotes.txt`, with a list of quotes for `!quote`, separated by double-newlines (ie, one complete blank line between each distinct quote).
- Within the `config` directory, create file `config.fds` (a FreneticDataSyntax file) with the following options (See also the full file text sample below) (most lines are optional):
    - `valid_channels` set to a whitelist of channels the bot responds in (left out = responds anywhere).
    - `info_replies` set to a submapping of info commands and their replies, which allows comma-separated list keys. The first listed name on each line is the primary name. Type `\n` to add a line break.
    - `project_details` set to a submapping of project names to project details map, as follows:
        - `update` set to an update message for the project.
        - `github` set to a GitHub repo URL (if applicable)
        - `icon` set to a `.png` icon image URL.
    - `channel_details` set to a submapping of channels to details specific to the channel. Within each channel ID key is a submapping of the details, as follows:
        - `updates` set to what projects they correspond to (for the update command).
        - `docs` set to whether meta docs are allowed in this channel.
    - `url_base` set to the base URL of the meta website.
    - `rules` set to a submapping of rule IDs to their text.
    - `command_prefix` set to the command prefix (for non-ping-based usages of the bot).
    - `build_numbers` set to a submapping of project names to build number tracker details.
        - `name` set to the name that appears in the `plugin.yml`.
        - `jenkins_job` set to the Jenkins job name.
        - `regex` set to a RegEx matcher, with one capturing group to capture the build number from a larger version string.
        - `max_behind` set to an integer, representing how many builds behind one can safely be before a warning symbol should be displayed.
    - `acceptable_server_versions` set to a list of server MC versions (just the main version without sub-version, like "1.15", not "1.15.1") that are acceptable + tracked (older = outdated, newer = unknown).
    - `additional_meta_sources` set to a list of additional meta source URLs (should be direct zip links, like `https://github.com/DenizenScript/Denizen/archive/dev.zip`).
